# My Recipe & Shopping List App

This repo contains the Ionic App developed during the udemy's course
**Ionic 2/ Ionic 3 - Build iOS & Android Apps with Angular by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller** in the Section 7.
Unlike the original tutorial, to implement it I used Redux, a framework for the `app state management` and firebase' sdk for storing and loading data from database.

## Prerequisites
Follow the link for [Installing Ionic 3](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/ )

## How to run the project

    $user@linux: MyRecipeApp$> npm install
    $user@linux: MyRecipeApp$> npm start
