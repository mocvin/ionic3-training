# Awesome Places App

This repo contains the Ionic App developed during the udemy's course
**Ionic 2/ Ionic 3 - Build iOS & Android Apps with Angular by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller** in the Section 8.
Unlike the original tutorial, to implement it I used Redux (with **combineReducers()**), a framework for the `app state management`,
firebase' sdk for storing and loading data from database and
**angular2-google-maps** library for integrating ***Google Maps*** .
